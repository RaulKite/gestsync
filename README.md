# Highlights

- The trained network can be used for 2 tasks:
  - **Synchronisation:** Predicting the temporal lags between the audio and visual streams in a video solely based on gestures.
  - **Active Speaker Detection:** Determining "who is speaking" in a multi-speaker scenario without looking at their faces.
- Works in unconstrained settings for any speaker in any language.
- Wider applications: Since the model does not require face input, it eliminates the problem of corrupted, occluded or invisible face or lip regions. 
- Complete training and inference pipelines, along with pre-trained models will be released soon.
